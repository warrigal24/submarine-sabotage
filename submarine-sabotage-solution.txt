Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These can be omitted once you know what to do.

(Z) (it takes 4 hours for filtration system to clear air of toxic substances)
SLEEP (you're woken by a bang, it feels like sub has landed on ocean floor)

OPEN INNER HATCH
U
(U) (opening is out of reach)
